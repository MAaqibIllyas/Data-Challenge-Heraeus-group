## Time-series Data | Data Visualization | Exploratory Data Analysis | Machine Learning Model | Model Evaluation


### Task
An IoT device with 3 different sensors to track machine health gives temperature, pressure and water level measurements. Machine status is tracked automatically by the machine considering 4 modes: Running/ Idle/ Off/ Failure. Data is transmitted at a frequency of 1 minute for one week. The Data quality could be compromised due to Data transmission issues. The Time-series measurements data is analyzed and the Machine status is perdicted using a Machine learning model. 

The following steps are taken for this project:


* #### Generation of Time-series Sensors Data

* #### Addition of Data Transmission Issues  
  (Missing & Static values and Noise)

* #### Exploratory analysis of Machine status

* #### Building a Model to predict Machine status   
  (Support Vector MAchine)

* #### Evaluation of Model  
  (Confusion matrix, Classification report)

* #### Ideas about the Optimization of Machine Efficiency
